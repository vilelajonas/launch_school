# Question 3

# The result of the following statement will be an error:

puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)

# Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

ANSWER:

  => It's not possible to concatenate a string with an integer.

  => "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

  or

  => "the value of 40 + 2 is #{(40 + 2)}"

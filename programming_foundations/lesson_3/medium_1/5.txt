# Question 5

Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of 
the factors of the input number:

def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  begin
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end until dividend == 0
  divisors
end

Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is 0, or a negative 
number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you change the loop 
construct (instead of using begin/end/until) to make this work? 
Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or 
negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead
of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

Bonus 1

What is the purpose of the number % dividend == 0 ?

Bonus 2

What is the purpose of the second-to-last line in the method 
(the divisors before the method's end)?


ANSWER:

def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  while number > 0 && dividend > 0
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end
  divisors
end

BUNUS1:
  => get the rest of the division (check if number is divisible by dividend)

BONUS2:

  => IT will determine the result of the method.

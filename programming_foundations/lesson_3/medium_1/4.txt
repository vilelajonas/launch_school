Question 4

What happens when we modify an array while we are iterating over it? What would be output by this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end
What would be output by this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end


ANSWER:

  => It dependeds on what method we are calling. ex: with we iterate throw an array using the method #each, nothing will happen to the array if we don't use inside the block a method that mutates the array. But if we iterate throw it using #map!, it will change the original array.

  => FIRST CODE OUTPUT:
    (wrong answer...)
  => 1
  => 2
  => 3
  => 4
  => [2, 3, 4]

  (the correct answer is:)
  => 1
  => 3
  => [3, 4]


  => SECOND CODE OUTPUT:

  => 1
  => 2
  => [1, 2]

Question 7

Alyssa asked Ben to write up a basic implementation of a Fibonacci calculator, A user passes in two numbers, and the calculator will keep computing the sequence until some limit is reached.

Ben coded up this implementation but complained that as soon as he ran it, he got an error. Something about the limit variable. What's wrong with the code?

limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"

How would you fix this so that it works?

ANSWER:

  => The problem is: fib method will not have access to the limit variable declared outside of it.

  => To fix it, you should pass a third parameter to fib:

  def fib(first_num, second_num, limit)
    while second_num < limit
      sum = first_num + second_num
      first_num = second_num
      second_num = sum
    end
    sum
  end

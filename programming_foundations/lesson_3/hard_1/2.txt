What is the result of the last line in the code below?

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings

ANSWER:
(wrong)
=> { a => 'hi' }

(correction:)
"The output is {:a=>"hi there"}. The reason is because informal_greeting is a reference to the original object. The line informal_greeting << ' there' was using the String#<< method, which modifies the object that called it. This means that the original object was changed, thereby impacting the value in greetings."

Question 4

The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1)

  => IT DELETES THE NUMBER AT INDEX 1
  => [1, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.delete(1)

  => THE ELEMENT 1 WILL BE DELETED:
  => [2, 3, 4, 5]

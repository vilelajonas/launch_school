# Capitalize Words

# Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string 
# that contains the original value of the argument, but the first letter of every 
# word is now capitalized.

# You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters, and 
# that only the first character of each word must be considered.

# Examples

def word_cap(string)
  string.split.each { |word| word.capitalize! }.join(' ')
end

p word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
p word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
p word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

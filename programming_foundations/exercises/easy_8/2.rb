# Madlibs

# Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks 
# for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place 
#   them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, 
# and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

# Example

# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly

# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

puts "Enter a noun:"
noun = gets.chomp
puts "Enter a verb:"
verb = gets.chomp
puts "Enter an adjective:"
adjective = gets.chomp
puts "Enter an adverb:"
adverb = gets.chomp

sentence_1 = "Do you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's hilarious!"
sentence_2 = "The #{adjective} #{noun} #{verb}s #{adverb} over the lazy dog."
sentence_3 = "The #{noun} #{adverb} #{verb}s up #{adjective} Joe's turtle."

puts [sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence_3].sample

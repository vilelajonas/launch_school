# Combining Arrays

# Write a method that takes two Arrays as arguments, and returns an Array that 
# contains all of the values from the argument Arrays. There should be no 
# duplication of values in the returned Array, even if there are duplicates 
# in the original Arrays.

# Example

def merge(array1, array2)
  (array1 + array2).uniq
end

p merge([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

# Fibonacci Number Location By Length

# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) 
# such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number 
# is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the 
# natural world.

# Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results 
# grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number 
# is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering 
# that it takes 6 iterations to enter the 2 digit numbers.

# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci 
# number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. 
# (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

# Examples:

def find_fibonacci_index_by_length(integer)
  fibonacci = [1, 1]
  until fibonacci[-1].to_s.length >= integer
    fibonacci << (fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2])
  end

  fibonacci.length
end

p find_fibonacci_index_by_length(2) == 7
p find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10) == 45
p find_fibonacci_index_by_length(100) == 476
p find_fibonacci_index_by_length(1000) == 4782
p find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10000) == 47847

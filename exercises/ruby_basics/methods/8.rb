# The variables below are both assigned to arrays. The first one, names, 
# contains a list of names. The second one, activities, contains a list of 
# activities. Write the methods name and activity so that they each take the 
# appropriate array and return a random value from it. Then write the method 
# sentence that combines both values into a sentence and returns it from the 
# method.

# Example output:

# George went walking today!

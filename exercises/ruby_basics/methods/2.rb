# Write a method named greet that invokes the following methods:

def say_hello
  'Hello'
end

def say_world
  'World'
end

# When greet is invoked with #puts, it should output the following:

# Hello World

# Make sure you add a space between "Hello" and "World", however, you're not 
# allowed to modify say_hello or say_world.

def greet
  "#{say_hello} #{say_world}"
end

puts greet

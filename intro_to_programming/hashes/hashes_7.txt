Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

ANSWER:

In my_hash x is a symbol

In my_hash2 x takes the value of the variable x as a key. 
The same as 
  my_hash2 = { "hi there" => "some value" }
